**Introduction:**
A marketing analysis chatbot can provide several valuable benefits:

**24/7 Availability:** It offers round-the-clock support for users seeking insights, making data analysis accessible at any time without needing human intervention.

**Instant Responses:** Users can get immediate answers to their questions about marketing campaigns, saving time compared to searching through reports or waiting for a response from a team member.

**Data-Driven Insights:** By analyzing marketing data, the chatbot can provide actionable insights, trends, and performance metrics, helping businesses make informed decisions.

**User-Friendly Interface:** It simplifies complex data analysis, making it easier for non-technical users to interact with data and understand campaign effectiveness.

**Enhancing Marketing Strategies:** By analyzing performance and trends, the chatbot can help refine marketing strategies, optimize budgets, and improve overall ROI.

**Learning and Improvement:** Over time, the chatbot can learn from interactions, becoming better at answering questions and providing relevant insights based on user behavior.

There are 2 files which contain the code of the chatbot:

The question_answering one code gives general answers to the user's question related to the marketing data.

The detailed_que_ans code file gives the stats, filter, summary and trends of the marketing analysis and also answers the user's questions.

I have used a small subset of data which contains 2K entries, the actual dataset contains 2 Lakh entries.
